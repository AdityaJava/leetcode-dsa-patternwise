Tree Property

For a graph with n nodes:

A tree is a connected and acyclic graph.

Therefore, a tree must have exactly n - 1 edges.

If:

Edges < n - 1 â†’ Graph is disconnected (not all nodes connected).

Edges > n - 1 â†’ Graph has a cycle (too many connections).

So before doing any cycle or connectivity check,
ðŸ‘‰ we can immediately reject the graph if edges.length != n - 1.
