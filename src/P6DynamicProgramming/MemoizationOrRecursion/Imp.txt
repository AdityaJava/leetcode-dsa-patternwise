DP Direction Insight – Top-Down vs Bottom-Up (Frog Jump)
Top-Down DP is:

Cleaner and more intuitive.

Matches the question naturally:
➤ “What is the minimum cost to reach the last step?”

You think in terms of:
➤ “To get to step i, how could I have arrived here at minimum cost?”

Bottom-Up Recursion (0 → n-1):

Possible but not natural for this problem.

Requires exploring all forward paths, which adds complexity.

✅ So for this type of problem, Top-Down DP is the better fit.
