🔄 Comparison in a Nutshell: Recursion Styles

| Feature                        | Pick / Not-Pick                          | For-Loop Based                      |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Simplicity                    | ✅ Very intuitive for subsets            | ⚠️ Slightly more complex             |
| Subsets                       | ✅ Works well                            | ✅ Also works well                   |
| Combinations (choose k)       | ❌ Messy and hard to control size/k      | ✅ Natural and clean                 |
| Permutations                  | ❌ Doesn’t support tracking used elements| ✅ Easily handles with visited[]     |
| Optimizations (pruning, dedup)| ❌ Harder                                | ✅ Easier with loop + conditions     |

✅ For-loop based recursion is more **versatile and optimal** for:
- Combinations
- Permutations
- Subsets with constraints (like fixed size, no duplicates, etc.)

🔥 Recommendation:
→ Use **for-loop based recursion** as your default pattern for backtracking problems.


🧠 When is For-Loop Based Recursion Used?

| Problem Type                   | Use For-loop Recursion? | Notes                                      |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Subsets / Combinations        | ✅ Yes                   | Classic use-case                           |
| Permutations                  | ✅ Yes                   | Use visited[] or element swap              |
| N-Queens, Sudoku              | ✅ Yes                   | Loop helps place elements row by row       |
| Palindrome Partitioning       | ✅ Yes                   | Loop over split points                     |
| Word Break / Sentence Building| ✅ Yes                   | Loop over dictionary words                 |
| Tree DFS / Graph Traversal    | ❌ Usually not           | Use plain recursion or BFS/DFS             |
| Dynamic Programming           | ❌ Rarely                | Use recursion with memoization             |

🔑 Summary:
→ **For-loop based recursion is ideal for backtracking problems** where you:
- Explore multiple options from each point (e.g., subsets, paths, placements).
- Need fine control over constraints like order, size, or duplication.

→ Avoid for-loop recursion in pure DFS/DP problems where structure is already well-defined.
