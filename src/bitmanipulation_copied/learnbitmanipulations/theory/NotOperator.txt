The bitwise NOT operator flips each bit of its operand:
A 1 becomes 0.
A 0 becomes 1.

In Java, integers are represented as 32-bit signed values.
The bitwise NOT operator operates on all 32 bits of the integer.
Example in Java:

public class BitwiseNotExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5;
        int result = ~x;
        System.out.println("~" + x + " = " + result);
    }
}
OUTPUT
~5 = -6
