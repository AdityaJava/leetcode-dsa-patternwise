1's Complement
1's complement of a binary number is obtained by inverting all bits (changing 0 to 1 and 1 to 0).

Uses: Simplifies subtraction by negating numbers.
Limitation: Two representations for 0 (positive and negative).
Example:
Binary: 1010
1's Complement: 0101

2's Complement
2's complement of a binary number is obtained by adding 1 to its 1's complement.

Uses: Standard representation for negative numbers in computers.
Advantage: Single representation for 0 and simpler arithmetic operations.
Example:
Binary: 1010
1's Complement: 0101
2's Complement: 0101 + 1 = 0110
