In computers, negative integers are typically stored using a method called two's complement

Let's take an example with an 8-bit system to represent the integer -5 in binary.

First, represent the positive integer 5 in binary:

5 in binary (8-bit) is 00000101.
Invert all the bits:

11111010 (inverted bits of 00000101).
Add 1 to the result:

11111010 + 1 = 11111011.
Thus, -5 in two's complement using 8 bits is 11111011.

Note: this 2s compliment only should be taken for calculations
